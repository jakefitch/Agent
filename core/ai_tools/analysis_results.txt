1. **Claim Status:** The claim status is "Processed as Primary", which indicates that the claim was processed and paid.
2. **Reason for Payment:** There are no specific reasons mentioned in the data that would suggest the claim was denied or rejected. However, upon reviewing the services and amounts, I noticed that the total allowed amount is $119.53, and the total paid amount is $159.47, which suggests that there may have been additional adjustments or payments made beyond the initially allowed amount.

Key details about the claim:

* **Amounts:** The total billed amount is $279.00, the total allowed amount is $119.53, and the total paid amount is $159.47.

------------------------------

Claim 3:
------------------------------
As an expert medical claims analyst, I've analyzed the provided claim data. Here's my assessment:

**Claim Status:** Processed as Primary

**Payment/Denial:** Paid

The claim has been processed and paid in full. The "claim_status" is listed as "Processed as Primary", indicating that the claim was processed as the primary claim for this patient.

**Key Details:**

* **Patient Information:** Paezli Chaffin
* **Claim Number:** 3
* **Total Billed Amount:** $209.00
* **Total Allowed Amount:** $140.00
* **Amount Paid:** $69.00

The claim has two service lines, with the first one being a "V2020" procedure and the second one being a "V2103" procedure. The total billed amount is $209.00, but after adjustments and deductibles, the total allowed amount is $140.00. The provider paid $70.00 for the services rendered.

There are no indicators of denial or rejection in the provided data. Therefore, I conclude that this claim was paid in full.
------------------------------

Claim 4:
------------------------------
Based on the provided claim data, here is my analysis:

**Was this claim paid or denied?**

This claim was partially paid.

**If denied, what was the reason?**

The claim was not entirely denied, but there are some notable adjustments and codes that suggest the patient had a copayment or coinsurance amount due. Although the "patient_responsibility" field is empty, the "copay_amount" and "coinsurance_amount" fields indicate that the patient had to pay $0.00 out-of-pocket. This suggests that the claim was partially paid by the insurance provider, but there might be an outstanding balance owed by the patient.

**Key details about the claim (patient, amounts, etc.)**

* Patient name: Paezli Chaffin
* Claim ID: 2412161576096
* Billed amount: $115.00
* Allowed amount: $98.00
* Deductible amount: $0.00
* Coinsurance amount: $0.00 (but there might be an outstanding balance)
* Copay amount: $0.00 (but there might be an outstanding balance)
* Procedure code: S0620 (not specified, but likely related to a surgical procedure)

The claim was processed as primary, and the rendering NPI (National Provider Identifier) is 1639335516, which suggests that it was submitted by a healthcare provider. The remark codes "N381" indicate that there might be additional information or clarification needed for future claims processing.

Overall, while the claim was partially paid, there appears to be an outstanding balance owed by the patient due to copay or coinsurance amounts.
------------------------------

Claim 5:
------------------------------
Based on the provided claim data, here's my analysis:

**Was this claim paid or denied?**
The claim was partially paid.

**If denied, what was the reason?**
Since the claim was not entirely denied, there is no specific denial reason to report. However, I'll highlight some key points that might have contributed to the partial payment.

**Key details about the claim (patient, amounts, etc.)**

1. **Patient Information**: The patient's name is Faith Cummings, and they are also listed as the insured.
2. **Claim Status**: The claim was processed as primary, indicating it was submitted by the provider or a clearinghouse on behalf of the patient.
3. **Service Line**: There is only one service line in this claim, which corresponds to procedure code S0620 (Simple Excision of Hemorrhoid) rendered on December 11, 2024, with a billed amount of $115.00 and an allowed amount of $98.00.
4. **Payment Information**:
	* The patient had no deductible or coinsurance amounts applied.
	* There was a copay amount of $0.00 (likely because the patient is fully insured).
	* The provider paid $98.00, which is the allowed amount minus other adjustments.
	* Total paid to the patient was $17.00, indicating that the provider paid the majority of the claim.

The partial payment may be due to the "other adjustments" of $17.00 (explained by the adjust code CO-45), which could be related to a contractual agreement between the provider and the payer.

------------------------------

Claim 12:
------------------------------
Based on the provided claim data, here is my analysis:

**Was this claim paid or denied?**
The claim was partially paid.

**If denied, what was the reason?**
Not applicable, since the claim was not entirely denied. However, upon reviewing the claim details, I noticed that one of the procedure codes ("V2020") had an adjustment code "CO-45" which may indicate a coding error or lack of supporting medical documentation. This could potentially impact future claims.

**Key details about the claim (patient, amounts, etc.)**
* The patient is SESLIE ESCOBAR RINCON.
* The claim has two service lines:
	+ Service Line 1: Procedure code "V2020" with a billed amount of $99.00 and allowed amount of $70.00.

------------------------------

Claim 13:
------------------------------
Based on the provided claim data, here is my analysis:

**Claim Status:** Processed as Primary

**Payment Decision:** PAID (in part)

The claim was paid in the amount of $17.00, which represents the "other adjustments" made to the original billed amount.

**Reason for Denial:** The claim was not denied entirely due to the adjustment codes listed ("CO-45"). These codes indicate that the primary insurance carrier is responsible for paying the claim (since it's marked as "Processed as Primary"), and a portion of the claim was paid. The remaining balance, however, was subject to other adjustments, which reduced the allowed amount to $98.00.

------------------------------
Based on the provided claim data, here is my analysis:

The claim was denied due to the "CO-B13" adjustment code in the service line details. This code likely represents a coinsurance adjustment, indicating that the patient is responsible for paying the full amount of $79.00 (since the allowed amount is $0.00).

**Key details about the claim**
